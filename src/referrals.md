# {{title}}

I use a lot of services that often offer referral codes. If you end up signing up for a similar service, use the links below and we'll both get money off. To quote an animated Meerkat, simples.

##  Freeagent

The premier accounting software. I don't use half of the features, and still think its incredible value for money. Sign up using the link below and we both get 10% off.

##  DNSimple

More often than not, CNAMEs, A Records, and everything else confuses the hell out of me. DNSimple made it super easy, and it is pretty cheap given its power. Sign up using the link below and we both get $5 credit.

##  TransferWise

After moving to Canada, I had to learn a lot about international money transfers. The most important thing I learned is that TransferWise makes it easy, quick, and cheap! If you sign up using the link below, you'll get a free Â£500 transfer.
