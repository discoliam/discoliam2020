# {{title}}

Originally designed and developed across the globe, this version was re-built December 2019 - April 2020 in Vancouver, British Columbia, using a combination of blood, sweat, and [Stack Overflow](https://xkcd.com/979/).

Typeset in [Popins](https://github.com/itfoundry/Poppins) by [Indian Type Foundry](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/), and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson.

Designed by [Patricia Bernal]( http://patriciabernal.ca/).

## Build

Built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates. CSS is built using [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) which has been a bit of a learn curve after 8 years of SASS, but there you go.

Source code and more details available on [Github](https://github.com/discoliam/discoliam2020).

Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
