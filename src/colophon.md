Originally designed and developed across the globe, this version was re-built December 2019 - January 2020 in Vancouver, British Columbia, using a combination of blood, sweat, and [Stack Overflow](https://xkcd.com/979/).

Typeset in [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) originally by [Matt McInerney](https://matt.cc/), and [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville) by Pablo Impallari.

Designed on an Apple Mac using Sketch, Visual Studio Code, Firefox, and some trial and error.

Built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Source code and more details available on [Github](https://github.com/discoliam/discoliam2020).
