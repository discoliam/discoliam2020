I don't really like talking about myself, but, needs must. If you only read one page about who I am and what I do this year, make it this one.

## TL;DR

I'm a web developer and Technical Lead with 10 years of experience. I'm passionate about Front End Dev, Performance, A11y, Pizza, and shouty music.

## Not long Enough
For about 10 years or so I've been building Websites, Applications, Digital Installations, and some other random bits in-between. This has been about a 50/50 split between full time at agencies, and as a freelancer working for one-person bands, to multi-million dollar startups and everyone in-between.

Over the years I've done a little bit of everything, but these days I've found myself working on modular-based websites, design systems, or startups. Most of my work over the last year or so has been based on Wordpress or Fractal, and a mix of different Static Site Generators.

I've played an active part in all stages of the project lifecycle. Working closely with Designers and Clients directly to define project goals and deliverables, to working with different teams of designers and developers to build those deliverables. I've joined projects at the very start of the processes, and have also been parachuted in days from launch to fix those last-minute bugs or add new features.

If the library/tool/system/platform/whatever you need doing isn't in the list above, please get in touch anyway. Chances are I either forgot to add it to the list, or I'd be keen to learn.

## Where in the world
I'm currently living in <del>sunny</del> rainy [Vancouver, BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver), which has been home for over 2 years now. I'm originally from the UK. I grew up in the town of [Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet,_Hampshire), went to [university](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol) and stayed for 10 years or so.

I've also worked in Continental Europe, Australia, and the US for some shorter stints of time over the years.

## Extracurricular
I think its fair to say I like being outdoors if the weather isn't too dreadful. I'm mostly cycling, be that road, gravel, or MTB. I also hike (slowly) and surf (poorly). Most weekends in the summer I like to get out camping, and currently getting into bike-packing. In the past year or so I've started snowboarding, another sport I'm proud to say I'm bad at, but at least I'm trying.
