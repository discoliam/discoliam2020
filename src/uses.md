Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/) (as I found his resource very useful) this is a quick rundown of the things I use day to day for work / general messing around.

##  Editor + Terminal

For the past couple of years, I've been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and I'm really happy with it. Before that I was using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). And before that it was [TextMate](https://macromates.com/).

In VSCode, I'm using Wes's [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) and the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).

I purchased [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) for all my mono-spaced needs. Unfortunately I don't think its being developed  anymore, but for the price, its a great font, and I find the ligatures and italics super useful when coding.

If not using VSCodes built in Terminal, I've been running [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) , but to be honest its quite rare I open it these days.

I switched to [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) a couple of years ago, again stealing [Wes's](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) setup, and I'm pretty happy with that.

##  Desktop Apps

I switched my main browser back to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) when Quantum came out. Some performance issues on heavy animations aside, I'm very comfortable with it, especially have less eggs in the Google basket.

If I have to do any vector work, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is my go to. I'm slowly trying to learn its full range of features. But I'm hyped for its team focused stuff coming out this year. At work, we use [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to share designs around the team, which is saved so much time, I love it.



##  Hardware

 I have a 13inch [Macbook Pro (2016)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-3.3-13-late-2016-retina-display-touch-bar-specs.html). I don't love it, but my mid 2012 machine was falling apart. I picked up a refurbished [LG Ultrafine 4K](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/HMUA2VC/A/lg-ultrafine-4k-display?fnode=8a) display, which I really like for the size / price I found.

In the office I'm using the [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/mx-master-3) mouse after I had some pain in my wrist, which seems to have solved the issue. At home I'm still using the Magic Mouse (first version) a friend  gave me.

Keyboard wise I'm using the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. [Space Gray and Wireless](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MRMH2LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-space-grey) at home, white and wired in the office. I should really switch those over.

My mouse mat is a [Steelseries QCK ](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-series#qck-large), mostly because it was black, thin, and available in large.

##  Audio

I'm not super nerdy about it, but I think I have an affordable but decent Audio setup, with a few different options. Unfortunately the record player and LP collection are back in blighty, so Apple Music will have to do for now.

For headphones, I have a pair of [Shure SE425-CL](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se425cl) and upgraded the cable to a [Shure RMCE-UNI](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/accessories/rmce_uni). I actually got them of eBay from a recording studio having a clear out, so they where near enough unused and pretty cheap. I have a backup pair of [SE 215s](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se215) in white which I take to the beach / camping etc.

I use a [Fiio Î¼BTR](https://www.fiio.com/%CE%BCbtr) Bluetooth Receiver to pair with my phone, as I kept breaking the USBc - 3.5mm adapters. Its cheap, but has [aptX](https://www.aptx.com/) support so doesn't sound too bad. I think I'll upgrade to the [BTR5](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) when they are available in Canada however, as you can use that as a USB DAC too.

For speakers I either use the internal ones on the LG Monitor or Macbook Pro, but if home alone or traveling I have a [Minirig](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-minirig-3). Mines a weird Hybrid of an original Bluetooth Model, with the chip-set and battery from a 2 from when I had it repaired. Its a bit bass-y for my music tastes, but you can't beat it's size vs loudness ratio. If / when we move back home, I will pick up another and the [Subwoofer](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/minirig-subwoofer-3) to build a small home HIFi setup that's also portable.
