Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/) (as I found his resource very useful) this is a quick rundown of the things I use day to day for work / general messing around.

##  Editor + Terminal

For the past couple of years, I've been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and I'm really happy with it. Before that, I was using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). And before that, it was [TextMate](https://macromates.com/).

In VSCode, I'm using Wes's [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) and the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).

I purchased [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) for all my mono-spaced needs. Unfortunately, I don't think it is being developed anymore, but for the price, it's a great font, and I find the ligatures and italics super useful when coding.

If not using VSCodes built-in Terminal, I've been running [Hyper](https://hyper.is/), but I don't open it that often.

I switched to [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) a couple of years ago, again stealing [Wes's](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) setup, and I'm pretty happy with that.

##  Desktop Apps

I moved back to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) when Quantum came out. Some performance issues on heavy animations aside, I'm very happy with it, especially having fewer eggs in the Google basket.

If I have to do any vector work, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is my go-to. I'm also a big [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) fan. I'm slowly dipping my toes into [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), so far I quite like it.

##  Hardware

I have a 13inch [Macbook Pro (2016)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-3.3-13-late-2016-retina-display-touch-bar-specs.html). I don't love it, but my mid-2012 machine was falling apart.

I picked up a refurbished [LG Ultrafine 4K](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/HMUA2VC/A/lg-ultrafine-4k-display?fnode=8a) display, which I like for the size/price I found.

My mouse is a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/mx-master-3) after I had some pain in my wrist, which seems to have solved the issue.

Keyboard wise I'm using the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. [Space Gray and Wireless](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MRMH2LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-space-grey). Thought I'm getting close to pulling the trigger and building a Mechanical Keyboard.

My mouse mat is a [Steelseries QCK ](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-series#qck-large), mostly because it was black, thin, and large.

##  Audio

I'm not an audiophile, but I like to think I've got a decent-ish setup for my current situation. Unfortunately, the record player and LP collection are back in Blighty, so Apple Music will have to do for now.

For headphones, I have a pair of [Shure SE425-CL](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se425cl) and upgraded the cable to a [Shure RMCE-UNI](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/accessories/rmce_uni). I got them off eBay from a recording studio having a clear-out, so they were near enough unused and pretty cheap.

Be it via my Phone and Bluetooth, or wired as a USB DAC to the laptop, I use a [BTR5](https://www.fiio.com/btr5) amp. I think it sounds pretty great for what it is and uses [aptX](https://www.aptx.com/) when in Bluetooth mode which will give me the best wireless audio I can hope for now.

I have a backup setup for Beach Trips/camping etc, which is a pair of [Shure SE215's](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se215) paired with a [Fiio Î¼BTR](https://www.fiio.com/%CE%BCbtr). It gives me slightly more battery life compared to the BTR5.

If home alone or camping etc, I have a [Minirig](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-minirig-3). Mines a weird Hybrid of an original Bluetooth Model, with the chip-set and battery from a 2 from when I had it repaired. Its a bit bassy for my music tastes, but you can't beat its size vs loudness ratio. I often think about picking up another one along with a [Minirig Subwoofer](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/minirig-subwoofer-3) to build a small home HiFi setup that's also portable. I wonder how that would play with the Record player when we do move back home.

## Other

*  My phone is a [Google Pixel 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_2) that is starting to show its age. I'm putting off upgrading, but I suspect I might finally jump to an iPhone this year.

* I also have an [iPad 6th Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(2018)) which I mostly use for looking up recipes in the kitchen or watching movies on public transport.

* My daily backpack is a hand made Daysack by [Big Top](https://www.instagram.com/bigxtop/). It's fully waterproof (rain-wise), I've had it for 6 years and I imagine it'll last forever.

* For coffee I use an [Porlex Mini](https://www.porlexgrinders.com/products/porlex-mini-grinder ) for grinding and a [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/) for brewing, both home and when traveling. I normally try and pick up some local beans wherever I happen to be in the world.
