Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/) (as I found his resource very useful) this is a quick rundown of the things I use day to day for work / general messing around.

##  Editor + Terminal

For the past couple of years, I've been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and I'm really happy with it. Before that, I was using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). And before that, it was [TextMate](https://macromates.com/).

In VSCode, I'm using [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) combined with the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme). I'm wondering if it is worth paying for [Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro)...

For fonts, I'm using [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) for all my mono-spaced needs. Before that, I was using [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/).

After experimenting with a few different terminals, I've switched back to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). I don't normally open it that often, as I normally use VScodes built-in terminal.

I'm using [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) in my terminal after years in bash. I'm currently using Wes's [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) setup, but thinking about forking it and writing my own thing soon.

I've been using [Fig](https://fig.io/) for a few months now and like it, especially as I can't remember my branch names half the time.

##  Desktop Apps

I moved back to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) when Quantum came out. Some performance issues on heavy animations aside, I'm very happy with it, especially having fewer eggs in the Google basket.

For design stuff, I'm now fully onboard the [Figma](https://www.figma.com) train. It's great.

##  Hardware

I have a [14 Inch Macbook Pro (2021)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-m1-pro-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-14-2021-specs.html). I wonder if I didn't need the extra RAM and power over the Air, but in the end, it was the extra screen real estate that sold it to me.

When I'm at home, it's hooked up to a [Dell UltraSharp 34 Curved USB-C Monitor (U3419W)](https://uk.pcmag.com/monitors/121496/dell-ultrasharp-34-curved-usb-c-monitor-u3419w) I managed to pick up from a PhD student who was selling it for far too cheap. My first curved monitor, but I'm impressed.

My mouse is a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/mx-master-3) after I had some pain in my wrist, which seems to have solved the issue.

Keyboard wise I'm using the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. [Space Gray and Wireless](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MRMH2LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-space-grey). I tried a few mechanical keyboards but ultimately preferred the low-profile style of the Apple model.

## Desk
During the winter of 2021/22, I decided to build a desk. The wood and hairpin legs were purchased from [Leeds Wood Recycling](https://www.leedswoodrecycling.co.uk/) and I then spent about 20 hours sanding off the oil and concrete on them. It's pretty wonky and has a definite curve to it, but I'm super happy with how it came out. I'm planning on building another in the summer, and this one will get donated to my father.

To protect my handy work I'm using a [Dotgrid Black deskmat](https://www.dotgrid.co/products/vegan-leather-desk-mat-black), mostly as it had a good review from [David Darnes](https://setups.co/posts/david-darnes).

##  Audio

I'm no Audiophile, but I do spend a lot of time listening to music, and I enjoy my slightly strange setup.

For records, I have a Numark tt-1700 turntable, which I was given by my step-brother as he no longer used it. It's not my ideal Turntable, and I'll upgrade it one day, but for now, it works. That's hooked up to a [ProJect Phono Box E](https://www.project-audio.com/en/product/phono-box-e/) phono stage.

Both the Turntable and the computer feed directly into a [JDS Labs OL Switcher into ](https://jdslabs.com/product/ol-switcher/), and then into a set of [Mackie](https://mackie.com) CR3s (which have since been discontinued). This allows me to switch between the two easily. A decent DAC is next on the list.

On the go, I'm using a pair of [Soundcore Liberty Air 2s](https://uk.soundcore.com/collections/true-wireless/products/a3910). I'm not sure how I ended up with these, but they will do until Apple release a new Airpod Pros.

I've still got a pair of [Shure SE215's](https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se215), as well as [Sennheiser HD 380 pros](https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/monitoring-headphone-studio-headphone-professional-audio-hd-380-pro) but I don't use either that often anymore.

## Coffee
This was the big lockdown hobby that now dominates my life. I've decided not to go down the espresso at-home route, which does mean the flat white in town is always a nice treat.

For grinding, I use a [Wilfa Svart](https://www.wilfa.co.uk/product/kitchen/black-aroma/) at home, and a [Porlex Mini](https://www.porlexgrinders.com/products/porlex-mini-grinder) on the road.

For Brewing, I use a [Hario V60](https://www.hario.co.uk/products/hario-v60-drip-decanter-pour-over-coffee-maker-700ml) or an [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/), of which for both I have a variety of paper, metal, and cloth filters. When travelling, I'll normally carry a [MiiR Pourigami](https://www.miir.com/collections/pourigami-travel-coffee-system/products/pourigami-portable-travel-coffee-dripper) if we're going somewhere without access to a good brewing system.

As for techniques, I'll do whatever [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/) recommends.

## Other

*  My phone is a [iPhone 12](https://www.apple.com/iphone-12/) after spending ten years on Android. Not 100% sure it was worth the cost of switching, but I do like not having a Google-based phone.

* I also have an [iPad 6th Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(2018)) which I mostly use for looking up recipes in the kitchen or watching movies on public transport.

* My daily backpack is a handmade Daysack by [Big Top](https://www.instagram.com/bigxtop/). It's fully waterproof (rain-wise), I've had it for 8 years and I imagine it'll last forever.
